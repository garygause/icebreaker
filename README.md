# icebreaker

LangChain project to generate introductions to tech professionals.

This project uses AI to scrape LinkedIn and X to find information on an individual by name and create a summary for us to view.  This info is then available to use as an "icebreaker" to start a conversation and initiate contact with a professional.

# Setup

LinkedIn scraping requires an app called Scrapin.
